A repository to display my previous data analysis projects and experiences. \
<br />
## **Project 1: [RCP Research Analysis](/Project%201%20RCP%20Research%20Analysis)**
_Programs Used/Needed: MATLAB_\
_Required Files: [RCP Data Analysis.mlx](/Project%201%20RCP%20Research%20Analysis/RCP%20Data%20Analysis.mlx) [climateStationData.csv](/Project%201%20RCP%20Research%20Analysis/climateStationData.csv), [ClimateModelDataAnnual.csv](/Project%201%20RCP%20Research%20Analysis/ClimateModelDataAnnual.csv)_ \
**Description:** A research project completed in University that compares precipitation data from a CMIP5 climate model to real world data to see if a regression model can confidently state if there is a correlation between the two. \
_Relevent Skills Used: importing, cleaning and analyzing data, creating figures_

## **Project 2: [Divvy Trips Analysis](/Project%202%20Divvy%20Trip%20Analysis)**
_Programs Used/Needed: R, Tableau(not yet uploaded)_ \
_Required Files: [DivvyTripsCaseStudy.R](/Project%202%20Divvy%20Trip%20Analysis/DivvyTripsCaseStudy.R) [202XXX-divvy-tripdata.rar](/Project%202%20Divvy%20Trip%20Analysis)  (from 2021-06 to 2022-05) (Included in project folder)_ \
**Description:** Google Analytics Case Study Project that analyzes data for a fictional bike-share company with the purpose of attracting more riders. The case study files are split into two sections R and Tableau. Initially, the R file, provided by google and set up by Kevin Hartman, was filled with outdated data which acts as skeleton for the user to follow with the purpose developing and displaying a basic understanding of data analysis tasks. The file attached is the updated variation, substituting datasets and cleaning them based upon the differences between the two. This demonstrates the ability to import and combine data sets, clean them to be ready for analysis, then lastly compare the variables from each of the datasets and plot them out.
